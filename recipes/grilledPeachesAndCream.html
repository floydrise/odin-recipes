    <p>
        This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful!
        Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!
    </p>
    <h2 class="description">Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
        <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="description">Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>
            Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill.
            Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over,
            and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was.
            Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.
